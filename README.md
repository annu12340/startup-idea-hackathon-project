Problem: These days all we come across and care about are successes - the product that hits the market, an idea that won a hackathon etc. But there will be a lot of ideas or products with potential, which never got to see a light because it never reached its destined hands or maybe the right environment. Almost 90% of startup ideas fail, and the idea gets stuck in the wave without being used by any.

Solution: Here we want to provide a platform for people to share the lessons they learnt, the mistakes they made so that people who might find a spark in those ideas can take them up and develop them into successful products/ ventures after analysing what actually went wrong => Creating something, out of nothing. Here people can post their ideas and details about startups ( funding rounds, description, history etc.) which others can see and take up. They can also connect and chat to discuss more on the idea. Any events related to startups can also be posted here.

Future plan: We also plan on implementing a subscription option for the startups so that someone who's keen on the idea can get updates on it. A payment gateway is to be implemented for selling the idea on the platform.
